##Tidy Data Assignment

The starting data set is downloaded and processed with the "run_analysis.R" R script. The output of this script is a "tidy" data set containing the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. The first column is the subject number and the second column is the activity. Each row represents averages for each variable by subject and activity.
